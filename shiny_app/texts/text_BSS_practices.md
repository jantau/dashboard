Researchers meet many more difficulties implementing some open science practices, than others, and this influences how often they are performed in practice. 

For example, open access publishing is perceived as relative easy to implement, and is correspondingly usually done. In contrast, data sharing is seen as complex, and it is done rather rarely. Open peer review might be an outlier, in that researchers rarely perform it not due to difficulties, but rather because most journals have so far nit implemented it.
