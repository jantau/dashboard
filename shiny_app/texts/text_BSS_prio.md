In the scientific system, different goals are present, which can be conflicting due to limited resources. Thus, scientists have to prioritize some goals over others, and presumably, the importance attributed to pursuing a certain goal is influenced by both external expectations and self-ascribed importance (i.e., internal values). 

As can be seen, for most scientific goals, there is a tension between external expectations <span>&#9711;</span> and internal values <span>&#9634;</span>.  The resulting overall prioritization <span>&#x25B3;</span> is, as expected for a trade-off, typically indicated to be between these two influencing factors.

Importantly, of all goals offered, open science is the least prioritized, and unlike for other goals, internal valuation of open science hardly has an impact on overall practice. 

The overall results indicate that researchers are caught in a tension between external expectations to maximize publication output, and their own values, which would first and foremost demand accuracy, but also that they allocate resources to e.g. good teaching and interdisciplinary cooperation. Only the originality of research results is both an external and internal value to a similar degree.
